It is so close that I could go there on foot, and that is why I chose it. However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\\n\\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\\n\\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\\n\\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \\n\\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions.

There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\\n\\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\\n\\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews.

On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \\nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \\nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE.\"}, {'_id': '238803427', 'date': '2018-02-27 05:00:00', 'listing_id': '10091713', 'reviewer_id': '13988353', 'reviewer_name': 'Selina', 'comments': \"We travelled with a 4 month old baby.

I was actually out and about pretty much the whole time from the moment I landed so I only dealt with Anette, but she was super friendly and pleasant. They keep their place clean and presentable so be sure to take your shoes off at the door! Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops.

The location is within walking distance from the Kew Gardens E/J Subway, and close to stores and fast food.  It is also right next to a major highway in Queens, which makes for easy road access.  The exact apartment is a bit hard to find so I recommend communications with Lane as the date of the stay gets closer so that she can help you find her place and coordinate your check-in.  The room is located in a third-floor apartment, and you need to use stairs to get there.  Lane is a fantastic host.  She is very responsive on email and helpful.

He met us at the apartment and gave us a tour, instructions for check-out, etc. He offered lots of ideas for things to see and do in Porto. He also wrote down a list of restaurants that he liked. He told us to get in touch with him any time if we had more questions. The apartment was spotlessly clean and the kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils, coffee maker, kettle, stove, etc. there was even salt, pepper and oil. Much appreciated as my husband and I cooked breakfast every morning. We LOVED the location. We walked everywhere from the apartment. Minutes from the Sao Bento(?) train station and many other attractions. There was a supermarket and laundromat within a few blocks as well as a variety of different cafes and restaurants. The apartment has been completely and tastefully updated and is completely secure.  We had a wonderful five days in Fábio’s apartment and would stay there again if back in Porto.

Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro.

This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities.\"}, {'_id': '8363944', 'date': '2013-10-28 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '1001265', 'reviewer_id': '7096845', 'reviewer_name': 'Jean', 'comments': 'Fantastic location!

The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana.

The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \\r\\n\\r\\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"}, {'_id': '11063672', 'date': '2014-03-18 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '1001265', 'reviewer_id': '12932701', 'reviewer_name': 'Tami', 'comments': \"If you are looking for a home base with the basics to lay your head at night and have breakfast in and then head out for the day this fits the bill.

Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area.

It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \\r\\n\\r\\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need.

The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It’s ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn’t make my stay any less incredible.

Our flight arrived at 11:45pm and left the next day at 10:15am. Ricky was great about communicating with me from beginning to end. He answered all my questions super fast! Even though I had a somewhat late arrival, his cousin Terry met us and had a dolly for our luggage. His place is like this hidden oasis. You take this cool walk through all these fruit trees. It looks like a forest! It's off the beaten path, but that's what adds to it's charm and appeal. When you get to his place, it's quiet and you feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle, but you're really not. \\n\\nThe room that we stayed in had a separate entrance from the house, so it was like we had our own apartment,  minus the kitchen. My boyfriend and I each had a backpack and a carry on suitcase. The room was a bit tight for us and our stuff, but it was manageable. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. It had all the amenities you would need...towels, soap, shampoo, comfy and clean bed, heat or AC (which we didn't use), safe place, and privacy. The room was just what we needed. We had our own bed and restroom. It was clean and it was close to the airport. Plus, there's wifi! Since I arrived kind of late, I texted Ricky about the wifi and he got back to me right away! \\n\\nThen, on our departure day, Terry had arranged a taxi for us and saw us off. It was like VIP service without the VIP price.  Overall, you can't go wrong by booking with Ricky and Terry. These guys know what they're doing. Their place is just what you need...if it's for one night or more...you'll get great hosts with a great place to stay.

It is everything their ad says and more. It really is about as far removed from the Honolulu tourist bustle as one can get. This is a huge bonus to experience Hawaii and a place to live and enjoy the people and untouched beaches along the Waianae Coast.  The Waianae Harbor is just down the road and is where many people from the Waikiki hotels get bused an hour to board the boats to go out for turtle and dolphin cruises.  But, you will be right there! The condo tower community is much more resort like than other condos (minus a restaurant on property), but with the many local restaurants nearby you will never get bored with the eating out options. The condo in modern with all the essential elements. The bathroom is large, the bed is comfy. This is one of the rare units with a screen front door so you can open it up to enjoy a cross breeze if desired and not get attacked by mosquitoes. The view is fantastic. Laundry is just down the hall. I highly recommend Ray and Lise's place!\\n\\nA word about Handicap Access: If you are handicap and need to avoid stairs, be sure to bring your handicap placard from your car so they give you a special pass to park in the resident parking. I have a bum knee so stairs are not my friend. The standard visitor parking in on the lowest level and is a bit of a hike and many stairs which is no issue for most travelers. There are no handicap parking stalls; all are on a first come basis so if you get back late at night, parking can be a challenge, but you can still avoid stairs by walking in a different door/elevator and making your way to the condo. The pool is three flights of stairs down; no elevator options. But, if you drive your car around to the pool there is a ramp up to the BBQ area to eliminate most of the stairs but you will still have about 10 steps up yo the pool to deal with. Unfortunately there is no wheelchair access to the pool.  \"}, {'_id': '282967325', 'date': '2018-06-28 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10266175', 'reviewer_id': '27498623', 'reviewer_name': 'Yongjian', 'comments': \"Ray and Lise's condo have stunning ocean view.

Williamsburg is charming, and there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants literally a few steps away. I particularly liked \"Samurai Mama\" and \"Snacky\", check them out if you\\'re into Asian food. There\\'s also the Williamsburg Music Hall and the Knitting Factory - well known venues where you can sample the local rock bands.

We're not the type that mind living out of our suitcases, so it didn't necessarily bother us, but I thought it was worth mentioning. \\r\\n\\r\\nAde was very quick with her communication, so getting into and checking out of her apartment proved simple and convenient \\r\\n\\r\\nI would say this is the perfect place to stay if you want a cute, centrally located Brooklyn home base with easy access to Manhattan and you don't plan on hanging out very much at the apartment... but it's New York, so what the heck are you doing hanging out in an apartment anyway?!?!\\r\\n\"}, {'_id': '100491029', 'date': '2016-09-09 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '103161', 'reviewer_id': '86205314', 'reviewer_name': 'Jessica', 'comments': \"We had a wonderful time in Williamsburg staying at Ade's place - very clean, tidy and stylish as the pics show!

The apartment is less than a half a block off of Bedford at a location that has a lot of good local bars and restaurants.  We felt very safe though there is a vacant lot that you could walk by on her street.  However, we did not make much of it, but you could walk on the other side of the street if that bothers you.  The street is well lit.  We worried a little about noise given Williamsburg's reputation for hipness.  However, this ended up not being a problem.  Restaurants were still open after 9, but you could still walk into them without reservations.  At night, it was busy enough to feel safe, but it was sparse enough for it to be farely quiet.\\n\\nGetting into Manhattan can be an issue.  The L train is the only train coming into the neighborhood.  If it isn't running, the closest stop is Marcy at the end of the Williamsburg bridge which is probably a 30 minute walk.  The ferry, which is a bargain, is close and will cross the East River and drop you off at 34th close to the UN Building.  However, it does not run after 9:30 in the evening.\\n\\nAde's building is a little ratty which you will see in the stairwell.  However, her apartment is perfectly fine.  The bed is comfortable which is nice compared to most Air BNB hosts.  There is a window unit AC for the entire apartment.  Depending on the time of year, I am not sure if it will cool the bedroom well since it's in a different part of the apartment (though there is an oscillating fan there).  We did not have a problem since it was October.  There is no microwave oven.  It is four flights up with pretty large stairs and no elevator.  I would avoid this apartment if you are elderly or handicapped.\\n\\nWe did not meet Ade which it is getting pretty common not to meet the host.  However, we had no problems.  The process to get the key was easy.  She had recommendations printed and posted in the room, and she was quick to respond to questions by messaging.\\n\\nFor our purposes, this was a great place to consider if the L train is running.  We would not stay her again if the L train isn't running.  However, if you don't mind working around the ferry schedule and you want to visit Williamsburg and Greenpoint, this will work well for you.\"}, {'_id': '354879082', 'date': '2018-12-02 05:00:00', 'listing_id': '103161', 'reviewer_id': '42046158', 'reviewer_name': 'Jeff', 'comments': 'Great location!'}, {'_id': '414047344', 'date': '2019-02-18 05:00:00', 'listing_id': '103161', 'reviewer_id': '39745252', 'reviewer_name': 'Rachel', 'comments': 'Ade’s apartment was clean, cozy, and in the heart of Williamsburg.

Andreia führte uns bei der Begrüßung nach oben und zeigte uns die Räumlichkeiten, welche den Eindruck bestätigen, der durch die Fotos entstanden ist: Für einen Kurztrip, wo ihr die meiste Zeit des Tages außerhalb verbringt. In der Parallelstraße überhalb der Rua das Flores befindet sich ein Supermarkt an dem wir uns mit dem nötigsten an Verpflegung für unseren Aufenthalt ausstatten konnten. Darüber hinaus gab uns Andreia viele Tipps zur Freizeitgestaltung in Porto. Sämtliche Anziehungspunkte sind aufgrund der zentralen Lage super einfach und in der Regel innerhalb von 10 - 15 Minuten Fußmarsch zu erreichen. An der angrenzenden Station Sao Bento fährt auch die Buslinie 500, welche euch in ca. 40 Minuten zum Stadtstrand in Matosinhos bringt. Wir haben die vier Tage in Porto sehr genossen und netterweise kümmerte sich Andreia am letzten Tag sogar noch darum, dass wir unser Gepäck nach dem Checkout sicher für ein paar Stunden verstauen konnten.

The apartment was spacious enough for us (a family of four) and the location was amazing.  You are steps to Central Park and to the 86th subway.  There are wonderful restaurants and shopping nearby if you need that but the small kitchen is fine for quick snacks and breakfast.  It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!

And the fact that it was a 5 minute drive from Volcano park was the icing on the cake. Mike is a real gentleman, informative, kind, and easy to contact. We will not forget the cherished experience he afforded. \\n\\n\\nWe particularly enjoyed the cabin's  rare blend of rustic charm and meticulously maintained, modern elegance. The beautiful wood interior with exposed beams, light scent of cedar, old-fashioned fireplace, and free-standing antique tub, all made the cabin incredibly charming. The wrap-around porch was not only scenic, but very quiet and mosquito free. It was a wonderful place to chat in the evenings, read selections from the bookshelf, and to enjoy the delicious breakfast items provided, including fresh papaya. Since the cabin resides at the end of the residential area, the only thing visible for miles from the back porch was lush, pristine forest. The cabin's enveloping sense of privacy was relaxing and romantic. \\n\\nWith respect to the cabin's modern appeal, where does one begin? Even the toaster lowered the bread automatically. One can enjoy coffee prepared by three different methods, including French press, and Mike made sure we had ample amounts of freshly ground coffee. The stainless steel fridge was packed with complementary goodies as well. Being expert snackers, we were quite pleased. \\n\\nThis understood, the modern conveniences went far beyond food. We enjoyed being able to dim the lights just the right amount in each room to create the desired ambiance. The king-sized bed in the loft was incredibly comfortable and featured three types of pillows, including a memory foam option. But the aspect of our stay we liked the most had to do with the modern architecture of the cabin itself. The walls of the A-frame design, both behind the bed and in front of it, feature large windows with breathtaking views of the forest. As a result, the typical distinction between interior and exterior does not apply. The effect was magical. Waking up in the morning, we were in awe. \\n\\nThanks again for everything, Mike. \"}, {'_id': '96826033', 'date': '2016-08-24 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10280433', 'reviewer_id': '49660157', 'reviewer_name': 'Daniel', 'comments': \"Mike's cabin in the clouds was top-notch!

He gave us a quick tour around, made sure we had an answer to all our questions, and even had two wonderfully fuzzy robes ready for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don't know what to do in Volcano, don't worry! Mike has great recommendations of what to do anywhere on the island, and gave us great ideas for where to go inside the park and around volcano as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this hasn't convinced you already, I'm not sure what will.

We really enjoyed dinner at the Kilauea Lodge. \\n\\nThe cabin itself is beautiful and charming. Mike has thought of absolutely everything and was very attentive to any needs we had. We could see the sunrise from our bed and on a clear night we could see the moon and stars. The cabin can be chilly at night and the area can get cold and rainy, so pack accordingly.

There are so many things to say here, but I'll just focus on the two most important and overarching areas of interest: the host and the home. The most accurate description I can relinquish of this host (Mike) is that he was kind, organized, informed, and impressively meticulous in his attention to detail. We actually ran into him by coincidence while out hiking the VNP trails and we were glad to share in part of a hike with him to have the chance to get to know him better. Our brief Mike-guided tour was just a nice bonus as he is an admirable conversationalist with an interesting life and is very knowledgeable of the VNP area. We have personally ranked him as our overall best host in all of our AirBnB stays to date, and that is saying a lot as we have been very fortunate to have nearly all positive experiences via AirBnB. Albeit, Mike sets the bar really high; the previous makes sense given he basically lives in the clouds in the shadow of a volcano. The home was incredible and in retrospect remains our favorite place we stayed this year on the islands of Hawaii and Maui (out of 7 other homes and/or hotels). Mike has obviously placed a lot of consideration into this offering and continues to build upon a rock solid foundation of thoughtful hosting. He easily supplies every utensil, comfort, amenity, and convenience you could expect and/or want in this upscaled cabin. There are all the expected and unexpected kitchen fixings, a small library in a large wall-shelf filled with Hawaii-centric materials, several dehumidifiers, music and lighting that just delivers a very creature-comfort cabin experience, and a slew of other add-ons provided to make life just a little easier on your trip. The interior of this house has so many fine things it's hard to list but our personal favorites were the 100-year old clawfoot tub (also functions as a standing shower), the tempur-pedic bed and ultra comfortable bedding, and last but not least the carefully selected combinations of wood all throughout the house, which make it feel like it's both somewhere old and somewhere new to its guest as well as blends the home into its earthy and forested setting just outside the glass doors. The lanai wraps around the unit and makes for an amazingly tranquil place to eat a meal or listen and watch the rain. The surrounding area is residential but spread out and Mike's place seems like it's in own little universe, tucked between the trees. We found the flying cloud was easy to find (via GPS) and an absolutely perfect spot for those looking to enjoy the VNP as its very close (<10mins) and makes for a seems-to-good-to-be-true home base. There are plenty of other things I could continue on to say in...\"}, {'_id': '122743156', 'date': '2016-12-25 05:00:00', 'listing_id': '10280433', 'reviewer_id': '6068562', 'reviewer_name': 'Srihari', 'comments': \"The best bnb experience we ever had - Mike's warm hospitality, the sound and view of the rainforest surrounding the cabin, the cabin itself (well designed, open, clean and well stocked), and the proximity to the National park.\\n\\nMike is a very friendly and warm person.

The home appeared clean but the host was clearly obsessed and spent a full hour telling us the do's & don'ts, while our dinners got cold and we were shivering on the porch... Ex: don't cook steak (no ventilation), don't leave the bathroom door open (humidity issue), don't wear shoes in the house, don't bring your suitcases upstairs to the bedroom, don't be concerned that the bedroom has no curtains, don't use the lights or the space heater too much because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, don't be alarmed to see the host working in the yard during our stay, and don't be alarmed if the host comes into the house while we're gone to get his yard tools, and on and on for an hour.  The whole experience was bizarre and uncomfortable.  The host wouldn't leave until we told him we had heard enough, that it was very late, that our dinners were now cold and so were we, and our groceries were sitting on the counter unpacked.  About an hour after the host finally left, my husband attempted to bathe and fell in the tub.  He could barely get out of the tub without falling again.  In all our stays in private homes and hotels, we have never previously experienced a tub so slippery.

He was nothing but helpful, occasionally checking in on us to see if we needed anything via the airbnb app.  We would often come back from the day to find he restocked all the food and even cleaned the sheets/towels mid-way through our stay (we stayed an entire week.)  He was helpful but also respected our privacy - we never saw him our entire stay.  \\n\\nThe pictures of the house do not do it justice.  It feels very secluded and yet is a minute from the main town road and a minute drive to Volcano National Park.

Mike also has a suggestion box in case we thought of something to make the place better, but we couldn't think of anything!\\n\\nAll in all, great location (short drive to Hilo, we rented jeep and traveled the whole island during our stay.), cozy and secluded house, great supplies, and a generous and helpful host.

We missed viewing the first night because we hit some fog but were able to return the following night to an intensely beautiful milky way/night sky contrasted with the glorious glow of Kilauea. Although Volcano is remote, it is a great set up to check out the green and black sand beaches. Mike is so thoughtful and aware of some of the limitations of the small town, he provided a wonderful little spread so that we might enjoy home-cooked breakfast and teas. He also has an extensive coffee setup for coffee folks as well. We slept very well and there are extra touches like comfortable bedding and thick towels that show Mike's put a lot of thought into folks' stays. It does get chilly in volcano but he's got that covered too; there is rain gear, a little stove that can be lit and small space heater if the temps dip.

It's perched on a cliff that overlooks the ocean and has million dollar views.\\n\\nThe house worked well for five adults (one couple and three others) and was clean and well appointed. There are even cookbooks displayed in the kitchen in case you wanted to get adventurous. One of the bedrooms is in a guesthouse in the back yard and it was a nice place for the couple to sleep and be apart form the others. Be prepared for visiting bugs, though.\\n\\nBelieve Cat when she says that you won't be able to park inside the gate without a high clearance vehicle but you will be able to park in the driveway if your car is on the small side. We had a minivan that was simply too big to allow for pedestrians pushing baby strollers to get by. Parking on the street is for two hours only and the nearest long-term free parking is s few blocks away. Remember to always leave space between you and the next car as locals seem to have no issue with pinning you in if you don't. \\n\\nCat was great about communicating with us.

Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.\\n\\nGreat location.

The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.

We originally planned both the ceremony and dinner outdoors, but due to the unusually windy weather, we decided to host the dinner in the spacious living room instead, which worked out great. Noah was very responsive and helpful before we arrived in Hawaii, as well as throughout the wedding weekend. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no issues with the hot water, the floors were clean when we arrived, and flies only became an issue when we left the doors open for long periods of time. There wasn't any sand on the beach in early March, but the water was calm and protected - perfect for wading around with water shoes. The house was fully stocked with amenities, and in a fantastic location if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu.

When we arrived, Mariya mentioned that there might be roaches (they do spray the apartment regularly, and there was spray under the sink). The presence of these bugs is not due to a lack of cleanliness- just a consequence of location on a tropical island. We had 6 unwelcome guests during the 8 days, but we were able to get rid of them quickly. This is not a criticism of the apartment or cleaning- but just something to be mindful of anywhere on Oahu. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would absolutely stay here again if I returned to the island, and highly recommend this studio.

It was clean and there were towels and beach towels available. The WiFi is truly high speed. In the mountains it can rain in september but don't let it disappoint you; when you go down  to Waikiki or the beach, the sun is shining and at the beach it's hot! I can recommend this place to everybody.\"}, {'_id': '107411179', 'date': '2016-10-10 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10578580', 'reviewer_id': '17130915', 'reviewer_name': 'Michael', 'comments': 'The neighbourhood was quiet and friendly and the studio was stylish and very well equipped.

The windows are hawaiian-style (as you can see in the pictures), which means you can have a nice breeze (a plus!), but also do not provide a lot of noise isolation if it gets windy outside. It is a quiet neighborhood however. You can also not darken the room a lot, if it matters to you.\\n2. For all you coffee-lovers out there, there is no coffee maker available. Instant coffee is provided though.\\n\\nOverall, we can recommend it and would come back if we were to return to the island.

Location wise it is in a quiet area, outside of the main hustle and bustle of Waikiki but you can easily reach places by car, or catch an uber into town which would cost about $18 dollars each way. It's a good location for getting around the island if you have a car as you can quickly and easily reach the main Highway to go North, East or\\nWest. You also have a safe parking space for your car at the Studio. \\n\\nThe view from the studio is fantastic, especially on an evening. We spent a lot of time at the outside area enjoying the views of Diamond Head and the Ocean. The Studio itself is well equipped; good coffee machine, oven, lots of kitchen equipment, beach towels, toiletries and a great hairdryer. If you're planning to cook any of your own meals during your stay than this Studio is perfect. The studio is quite cosy but we never felt like it was too small, it was perfect for our stay. \\n\\nThe information we received about the booking was excellent, Andrei sent me a check in video so I could see how everything worked first hand, and an email with clear information. Andrei also very kindly let us drop our luggage off at the studio when we arrived as our flight got in very early, this then allowed us to go off for the day with no hassle and was very much appreciated! \\n\\nI would highly recommend the studio, I hope to be back! \"}, {'_id': '130966278', 'date': '2017-02-09 05:00:00', 'listing_id': '10578580', 'reviewer_id': '73715549', 'reviewer_name': 'Nicole', 'comments': \"Such a wonderful place.

There were many freezer ice packs and snap lid food containers that we used to pack picnic lunches--bring a cooler bag.   The shower is great!  The only thing you need to understand is that the long term renters' (very nice) kitchen window faces the private lanai, so anything you say or they say can be heard.

Furniture dirty and dated.

Occasionally a moth or two would show up but we never saw any ants or roaches or anything based on what I’ve read. 2) the view: the view was incredible and waking up to the ocean every morning and going out onto the patio to have a coffee was a very romantic touch for my fiancé and I.\\n\\nThe only thing I would say is that if you are looking at spreading out and enjoy the luxury of having a lot of added space just verify that this place suits your needs. \\n\\nJhanna the host does a great job at communicating and is readily available for any and all needs.

The view can't be beat for that price, the bed was super cozy, and the water pressure in the spacious shower was really nice. The apartment is situated between a neighbor's home and another tenant. The tenants are quiet and neighbors came and went during our stay but note - with proximity to their place you can hear them talking pretty clearly if that bothers you. The neighbors also installed motion detector lights that are just outside the studio windows across from the bed. They were on all night (probably due to wind and trees). Andrei provides blankets to cover the windows, but it does not really block the light. If you are a light sleeper, bring a sleep mask. Be sure to clear any food and keep doors closed unless you want to see a visitor ;) We didn't see any until the last evening, but the biggest cockroach I've ever seen still startled me (I'm a spazz). The studio is treated, but the tropics can bring in some creepy crawlers. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the cozy studio. The porch is a gorgeous spot in the morning to enjoy your coffee and watch birds in the neighbors' yard.\"}]}\n",

Kauai’s north shore is also where you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in Hawaii. There are three main beaches in Princeville, which are Kenomene Beach, Kaweonui Beach and Puu Poa Beach. A wide reef along these beaches creates warm pockets for swimming and snorkeling in calm weather. Other area activities include tennis, golf, windsurfing, kayaking, fishing, sailing, helicopter tours and shopping.

We really wanted to see and experience Kauai the best we could. When we saw Coral's ad on Airbnb we knew it would fit all of our wants and needs. Upon arriving, we were welcomed by her husband Ian who took us around their beautiful property. Location is a huge plus with this hidden gem, it is only steps away from Queen's bath and a short 5 minute ride from Hanalei, which we frequented. The pool was beautiful, even though we only used it once. Coral does a great job in making sure her guests are comfortable. Her hospitality is in a league of it's own from offering fresh fruit she grew herself to local insights on what to do and where to go. We stayed in Princeville just before their winter months. It was mostly on the windier side, but it did not inhibit our travels. The only one  recommendation we have is if you decide to take a boat tour to the Na Pali Coast to see the open-ceiling caves, go during the summer or when the swells are below 4ft. Whale season is just starting at the end of October, so keep that in mind too if you do decide to take a boat tour. Otherwise, here are our top 5 picks picks Kauai: 1. Kalalau Trail (bring shoes with traction!), 2. Ishihara Market for Poke (see Waimea Canyon same day), 3. Lawai Beach for Snorkeling (next to The Beach House), 4. Queen's Bath (sunny and low swells), 5. Kilauea Town (bakery, juice bar, lighthouse lookout). Enjoy your stay in Kauai!

O fato de ter um cofre na porta de entrada ajuda muito se vc estiver viajando com outras pessoas. Assim a chave fica sempre guardada lá para caso as pessoas cheguem separadas no apto. Muito funcional.\\nA única coisa que eu sugeri pra Paula é ter toalhas. Chegamos lá e não encontramos toalhas. Apenas roupas de cama.

The snorkeling and other beach gear that came with the house also made our stay easier and more fun!\\nThe only con: Two members of our group needed the A/C to sleep.  We found that the A/C in the bedrooms upstairs were kind of loud as it shut off and on through the night.  And the house rule of running it at a 75 degree minimum still seemed warm to us.  But it was still better than nothing, since we didn't want to keep all the bedroom doors open all night to catch the cross breezes (for privacy and to manage the snorers).\\nOverall, I would easily recommend this place!  \"}, {'_id': '170527473', 'date': '2017-07-15 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10548991', 'reviewer_id': '131564309', 'reviewer_name': 'Bradley', 'comments': \"This was our first ever Air BnB stay and it won't be our last.

You should definately walk through the local bazaar on Sunday right beside the apartment. You can find anything you need with cheap prices; fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, meat, dairy products!

The Galata Bridge connects Karaköy with the Old City, on which the fast tram line Zeytinburnu-Kabataş runs with. This tram line goes to Atatürk Airport within 1 hour. Ferry boats run every 10 to 20 minutes from the ferry terminal on a pontoon to Haydarpaşa train terminal and Kadıköy across the Asian shore of Bosphorus.

Айбике быстро выходит на связь и всегда готова прийти на помощь.\\n\\tИз минусов, хочу заметить наличие сигаретного дыма, распространяющегося с нижнего этажа дома. А также высокий шум с улицы, который не прекращается даже ночью. Шум, преимущественно, исходит от лежачего полицейского, который устроен в виде больших граблей, расположенных таким образом, чтобы машины могли ехать только в одном направлении. Улица, на которую выходят окна квартиры, с односторонним движением и грабли срабатывают с изящным скрежетом каждый раз, когда на лежачий полицейский наезжают колеса автотранспорта. \\n\\tВ остальном хозяйка сделала все возможное для нашего комфортного проживания. Большое спасибо Айбике!'}, {'_id': '402068704', 'date': '2019-01-17 05:00:00', 'listing_id': '10486984', 'reviewer_id': '234695080', 'reviewer_name': 'Shazia', 'comments': 'This flat has an amazing location. It’s 5-6 min walk to taksim sq and famous İstiklal street, about 10min walk to nearest metro station. Has 24 hour food and  shops right outside the flat! Amenities are basic but suited us well. I would suggest taking slippers as the wooden floor is cold in winter,  leave the windows open to let in the hustle and bustle of Istanbul !! No balcony with a view, and there’s a flight of winding stairs to get to the flat which isn’t glamorous but the place is VERY safe!'}, {'_id': '406356181', 'date': '2019-01-29 05:00:00', 'listing_id': '10486984', 'reviewer_id': '102968824', 'reviewer_name': 'Guillermo', 'comments': 'Muy buena localización y muy buenos anfitriones!!

The place is really near to Taksim Square. Once you get out from the house, you can just walk up around 5 minutes. Then, you will be at the Istiklal Street and it just 5 minutes walk to get to Taksim Square. Also, it is so nearby to Galata Tower too. It is easy to connect with public transportation as the metro station is just nearby. This place is also nearby to the Istiklal Street. The famous shopping street in Istanbul. So, I highly recommend this place to anyone out there when you want to visit Istanbul. Aybike is a very good host. She offered me a help if i had left something in Bursa. Well that was a really over the top of attitude. What an amazing person she is!'}]}\n",

There’s are loads of places to eat and drink nearby and Mathieu was really helpful with regular tips about the best places locally and further afield. The old town where the apartment is , is a great place to explore but it’s really worth venturing elsewhere also and the buses are good and easy to use. We went to the beaches several times using the 500 bus. The flat itself is a perfect size for 6 people and there is a bed settee I believe but we didn’t use it. I think more than 6 would be overcrowded. Every thing we needed was provided. We didn’t need to ask Mathieu for any changes but he was very approachable and friendly and I am certain he would sort any problems out quickly.

Host service is a close second. Jenkin is an accessible and attentive host, and that's something you may need in a complicated city like Hong Kong. This is an efficiently designed very small space which makes it seem larger than it is. The layout is (1) a bed-sized sleeping area with a curtain and sliding door for privacy; (2) a comfortably sized and appointed bathroom with a nicely tiled shower with plenty of hot water and strong water pressure; and (3) a living room with comfortable sofa, reliable wifi, and clothes hanging rack. There is a fridge and microwave and hotplate, with enough cookware for two people. You wash your dishes in the bathroom.  All three rooms are recently remodeled and tiled.  The bed is very comfortable. Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \\r\\n\\r\\nI might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"}, {'_id': '73506770', 'date': '2016-05-08 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10343118', 'reviewer_id': '65460950', 'reviewer_name': 'Jj', 'comments': '我们去玩迪士尼很晚回来害怕要找一段时间,地理交通条件好出地铁口走几步就到了,很容易就能找到｡去维多利亚港看完夜景回来到楼下有便利店茶餐厅吃点东西非常方便,房子感觉卫生,有电视和无线网络整体感觉不错!'}, {'_id': '74234498', 'date': '2016-05-14 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10343118', 'reviewer_id': '31011591', 'reviewer_name': 'Alan', 'comments': \"The apartment is in a great location for exploring the Tsim Sha Sui area.

The living space is small but well organized, with a separate bedroom (just big enough for the bed) with its own air-con, and the bathroom is a very usable size. The main drawback to the apartment is that it is on the 6th floor of a 15 floor building and the queues can get long for the elevator. There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.  Of course this is not an issue the host can resolve, but I think any guests should anticipate.\"}, {'_id': '74369812', 'date': '2016-05-15 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10343118', 'reviewer_id': '69166808', 'reviewer_name': '曦子', 'comments': '地理位置很棒 (Hidden by Airbnb) 都比较方便'}, {'_id': '76222226', 'date': '2016-05-25 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10343118', 'reviewer_id': '70462561', 'reviewer_name': '大華', 'comments': '位置十分方便 近地鐵站 商場 晚上吃東西都方便\\r\\n房間有點小  浴室更小  有許多雜物堆放在櫃子裡  打掃也不乾淨  沙發上有需多頭髮  垃圾桶只有一個  因為不知去哪倒  對旅行的的人來說 不夠使用   \\r\\n浴室一沖水 浴簾就會亂飄 常會黏到身上  老實說以房間的價格還是打過折的  不如住飯店  既沒有價格優勢  環境也不太ok  '}, {'_id': '77360245', 'date': '2016-05-31 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '10343118', 'reviewer_id': '44915148', 'reviewer_name': 'Jesse', 'comments': 'Host was very friendly and accommodating!

Loved the location, so convenient to all parts of the island.  Gage was quick to respond to our inquiries.  The condo management were very nice and everyone staying there was very friendly.  Grounds are well kept.  My daughter loved playing in the pool with other children.  We enjoyed having a washer and dryer in the unit.  During the day when we were there, we just left windows and door open because the cross breeze was so nice. Many others did the same. The ocean waters on this side of the island are calm, especially in the morning.  So we enjoyed swimming and riding the waves during the day.  We loved morning walks along the beach and watching the sunset. The beach was not crowded and we really appreciated the beach chairs and beach towels provided by owners. We also appreciated the designated parking space. Condo had everything we needed for a wonderful Maui vacation.  We highly recommend this budget friendly rental.

Bathroom was very dirty with a broken toilet seat that was never fixed ...eventhough the staff was politely reminded each of the seven nights we stayed...holiday or no holiday...how can you be running a place like that? AC wasnt functioning, however, it was fixed by the end of second night and a fan provided as a replacement. In the end, it was exceptional as a budget place. I would highly suggest that the management take cleaning and basic hygeine into serious consideration (mold on the bathroom wall) the place could earn a 4 star experience with ease. '},\n",

Since I was traveling alone, I was given a room enough for a single traveler. The room in the listing is probably the room beside mine. Anyway it is not a big deal.
